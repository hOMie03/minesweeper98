# Minesweeper98 (inspired by [Nick Arocho's Minesweeper](https://github.com/nickarocho/minesweeper/))

Do you remember that Minesweeper game from Windows98? Yep, that old classic game you remember playing on your good ol' Windows PC back in the day. Now, it's available right in your browser!
Minesweeper has its origins in the earliest mainframe games of the 1960s and 1970s. The earliest ancestor of Minesweeper was Jerimac Ratliff's Cube. The basic gameplay style became a popular segment of the puzzle game genre during the 1980s.

Do you know what an actual Minesweeper is? I didn't either until I read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper).

## Getting Started
[Play the Game here](https://hOMie03.github.io/minesweeper98/)!

### Basic Gameplay
1. Select your difficulty level.
* Easy = 9x9, 10 mines
* Medium = 16x16, 40 mines
* Hard = 30x30, 160 mines
2. Click anywhere on the board to begin and start the timer.
*The numbers depict how many mines are adjacent to any given cell.
3. Use **"Shift + Click"** to add flags to a cell if you think it's a mine.


### Winning/Losing
* If you hit a mine... game over, broski.
* Win by uncovering all the cells without mines!

(get it... MINE... SWEEPER...?)

## Technologies Used
The good old Three Friends:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## My Design Choices
I decided to roll with the OG Windows '98 look, because I love the old era of Windows 98/XP as that was my childhood! Also, currently I'm working on a similar type of project related to Windows98, so stay tuned!

## Thank you for reading and playing the game! I hope you enjoy it and get nostalgic about those good 'ol days!
:)
